# Semistatic

## What's this?

Blogware with a twist!

Here's my goals:

- I should still be able to write standard HTML pages for my blog posts. If it turns out I want to create a post with non-standard structure - a microsite really - it should come with zero overhead.
- In the unlikely event any of the posts I write becomes popular, semistatic should be smart enough to route the viewers to the original static version.
- The software should be smart enough to do the basic things that the static generators do: aggregate pages, create feeds, group posts by tags. It should also be able to resize images, apply common styling, and in general work seamlessly with static data without using any special syntax. It should support transforming posts in any way imaginable. Syntax highlighting, math formulas - which Coleslaw can do by the way.
- Where it gets interesting is that I want to support functionality that has to be backed by a dynamic service. If I want to restrict access to certain posts as before - that should be possible as well. If I want to show how many people are viewing the post at the same time, if I want to support Medium-style highlights, ActivityPub - that too.
